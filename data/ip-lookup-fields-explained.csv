Field Name,Description,Common Data Source,Typical Accuracy,Notes
IP Address,The queried IPv4 or IPv6 address.,Network layer,Exact,IPv6 may be compressed (shortened) in display.
IP Version,Whether the address is IPv4 or IPv6.,Network layer,Exact,Some users have both (dual-stack).
ISP,Service provider associated with the IP allocation.,RIR WHOIS + commercial datasets,High,Often shows carrier or upstream provider.
Organization,Entity that owns/uses the IP range.,RIR WHOIS,High,May differ from the ISP brand name.
ASN,Autonomous System Number announcing the IP via BGP.,BGP routing data,Very high,Usually the most reliable ownership/routing field.
AS Name,Human-readable name for the ASN.,BGP/RIR,High,May be abbreviated or outdated.
Country,Country associated with the IP.,GeoIP databases + RIR hints,High,Country-level is typically the most accurate location field.
Region/State,Region/state associated with the IP.,GeoIP databases,Medium,Can lag behind reassignment or routing changes.
City,Estimated city associated with the IP.,GeoIP databases,Low–Medium,Often wrong; do not treat as precise.
Latitude/Longitude,Approximate coordinates derived from GeoIP.,GeoIP databases,Low,Not GPS—often points to ISP hubs or city centers.
Timezone,Timezone inferred from the location fields.,GeoIP databases,Medium,Depends on location accuracy.
Postal Code,Estimated postal code (if provided).,GeoIP databases,Low,Commonly missing or inaccurate.
Hostname (rDNS),Reverse DNS name mapped to the IP.,Reverse DNS (PTR),Medium,Often empty; depends on provider configuration.
IP Type,Residential / Mobile / Hosting / Proxy classification.,Heuristics + network metadata,Medium,Different providers may classify differently.
Proxy/VPN,Whether traffic appears to come from a proxy/VPN.,Reputation signals,Medium,False positives are possible.
Blacklist Status,Whether the IP appears in public blocklists.,DNSBL/RBL sources,High,Results depend on which lists are checked.
Abuse Category,"Likely abuse type: spam, proxy, malware, etc.",Reputation datasets,Medium,"Best used as a hint, not proof."
Connection Type,"Broadband, mobile, datacenter, etc. (if available).",ISP + heuristics,Medium,May be missing.
